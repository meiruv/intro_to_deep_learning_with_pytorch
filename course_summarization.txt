# sigmoid function is defined as sigmoid(x) = 1/(1+e-x), returns the probability
of each point to have each label for binary classification.

# softmax function, which is the equivalent of the sigmoid activation function,
 but when the problem has 3 or more classes


# exponential function only returns positive values so it solves 
our problem in cases where we might divide by zero.
